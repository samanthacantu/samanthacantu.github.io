	<p>i was born in tijuana, baja california, mexico and came to the us when i was three years old. i have been living in oakland my whole life and although it is not the best place to live in, i still have a love for this city; my hometown. my family and i have always been moving around the city which means i had to switch schools about five times throughout elementary which made it hard for me to make and keep friendships. i am also an only child which is pretty cool but this is another reason why i like to have friends to be with. right now, i go to san leandro high school where the environment is truly amazing and i met my two best friends. life's pretty good at the moment.   </p>


	<p> i enjoy spending time with my friends exploring places, riding around, shopping at thrift stores to buy goofy clothes. i also spend some of my time drawing, stargazing, and daydreaming.

	<p>and i like kpop.  </p>
